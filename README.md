# Affine-and-Jumble-Ciphers
An introduction to cryptography through the creation of a affine and jumble ciphers. 

The affine cipher project provides the user with 5 options, print encoding tables, encode message, decode message, change the shift by value, and quit. The message that the user encodes will be done using a randomly selected value for a that fits within the necessary parameters.

The jumble cipher project provides the user with 4 options, print encoding tables, encode message, decode message, and quit. The message that the user encodes will be done using a randomly ordered alphabet.
